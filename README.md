Can save a lot of wasted google drive space from accumulated older versions of MS Word files (i.e. .doc, .docx) and PDFs when you overwrite a file with the same name (update file in Google Drive). Google drive has by default "keep forever" setting enabled (right click  on file-->file information-->manage versions--> three vertical dots-->"Keep Forever"). Depending on your personal use and years passed, several GB can be wasted from google drive space. Instructions: Open the google "app script editor" here, https://script.google.com/home and load the script  "Uncheck Keep Forever in Google Drive.json". Read instructions inside the script editor and RUN the script. You must have previously logged in in your google drive. Bypass all google pop-up security warnings. This is normal. In my case I had reached 14.3GB from 15GB google drive space and the script  brought my space back to 11.7GB used GB. Saved 2.6GB of accumulated old versions of Word and PDFs files over a period of 7 years.
